# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of PyBer Ridesharing 
This analysis is meant to define the primary differences between city types and the amount of drivers, fare for a trip, how many rides are used, average fare per driver, and average fare by city type.
## Results
Overall, it is clear that the most profitable place for the company is the Urban areas, shown to commit double the profit compared to Suburban cities, and four to five times more than Rural cities.

over a six month period it is a consistent trend. 
However, when bringing in the average fare per driver, and average fare per ride, Rural makes an incredible amount more per ride.

almost double what Suburban cities average, and three to four times as much as the Urban cities. 
This point brings in another datapoint, Drivers. The amount of drivers per area is a drastic difference.

One thing to take into account, there are only 1,625 rides, but 2,405 drivers. This is something that shows a lack of consumers wanting to use the ridesharing capabilities that PyBer wants to revolutionize. Both Rural and Suburban cities have a great Total Rides to driver ratio. Urban Cities have a non profitable ratio that may cause other issues.

Although the numbers look great for total Fare amounts in the Urban cities, the ratio doesn't seem to be all there. Seeing as that the average fare per driver is significantly lower than any other City type.
# Summary
- Create a maximum driver amount for Urban cities (and with that, any Cities), with this analysis, we can conclude a ratio be formed per business need. (Urban areas have X amount of drivers, Suburban areas have X, Rural have X. Based on historic 'total rides').
- Increase business efforts for Suburban Cities, this can make up profits for both Rural and Urban, with the same costs as increasing efforts in Urban cities.
- Offer delivery services with ridesharing in Urban Cities, this would allow for the excess drivers to become delivery drivers instead.
